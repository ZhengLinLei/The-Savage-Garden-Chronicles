# 30th Of October 2024

Tragedy happened yesterday. All the places near my city has been flooded, and the weather has changed a lot. The rain has stopped this morning, but the sky is still cloudy and polluted, speacially the temperature has increased a lot. That's very bad news for my plants in dormancy. I hope everything goes well.


Due to this tragedy my exams have been postponed. Not bad, I have more time to study, but actually I will spend more time studying instead of taking care of my plants.


They cutted the water supply for a while, all the people started being crazy and storing water, but then everything went back to normal. Those days everyone is very sensitive.
