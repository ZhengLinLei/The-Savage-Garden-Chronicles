# 19th Of Octover 2024


Bad new, the smallest Drosera that I have, died. It become black and I don’t know why it’s happening that, maybe because the shock of environment cuz the plant before was inside a terrarium, but nosense, I followed all the steps that the laboratory recommended, I take it outside and I put it inside a glass bottle to simulate the same condition and I let it a couple of weeks and then I transplanted the drosera to my MeatLand. I have to say that the Drosera at the beginning was dying even inside the terrarium.

I found the species of the drosera seeds, maybe they are Capensis… or maybe they are some kind of hybrid. Also I found one small Sarracenia in the same pot of the Sarracenia Stevensii, and I transplanted it to the MeatLand, so now I have two Sarracenias in the tank. I think the small one is a Sarracenia Stevensii too so I will call it Sarracenia Stevensii Mini.

And finally I created my DIY greenhouse with a box and some aluminium, not very beautiful but it works. I didn't find any box in any trash so I had to buy one. Now I can simulate the greenhouse effect easily, for now the temperature is good, but I need to find a way to simulate the humidity, maybe with a humidifier or a fogger, and also I have to simulate the winter temperature.
