# 22nd Of October 2024

At 19:00 started raining so I took my girlfriend's bowl outside the street to collect some rainwater. But, only after 10 minutes, the rain stopped. I was able to collect a little bit of water.

I was afraid that someone will steal my girlfriend's bowl, and after looking the amount of water I collected, I decided to create a DIY rainwater collector. Not too big but enough to collect water for my plants.
