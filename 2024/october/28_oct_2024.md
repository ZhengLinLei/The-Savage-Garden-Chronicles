# 28th Of October 2024

Today it said that it would rain, but it didn't. And I was planning to get some water, since I put it outside it didn't recollect any water.

I'm still studying for the exams, so I didn't do much today. However, I did some light rotation of the plants. Althogh the plants are in dormancy and since the temperature is not that low, they are still needing light and growing. So I decided to put the light for the Sarracenias and the Venus for 6 hours, but there are too much plants, and it doesn't cover all of them so I decided to separate them in two rounds.
