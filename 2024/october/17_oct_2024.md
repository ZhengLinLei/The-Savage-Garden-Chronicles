# 17th Of Octover 2024


Today I bought two new plants, a **Sarracenia Stevensii** and a **Drosera Aliciae** . Actually the pot of sarracenia has 2 sarracenias, a big one and a small one, and I'm thinking to transplant the small one to the fish tank, also I put a name to tank calling it "MeatLand" because today since it was a windy day many flies were pushed by the wind into our flat, so I was killing all because there was a lot, mainwhile I catched many flies to feed to my plants and I think they have enough food for almost three months. And that's why I decided to call my tank "MeatLand", because plant in my hand, plant with meat.

I need to create a small greenhouse with a box and some aluminium of solid mirrors, not regular to avoid burns in certain degrees of the light. I will do it tomorrow if I have time.
