# 18th Of Octover 2024


Before telling you what I did today I'm going to show you all the flies I catched yesterday. There are like 20 flies in the bottle going to be food for my plants.

I adquired some seeds of **Drosera** (I don't know the species, I'm sorry but I tried to search it but until it isn't have grown up I can't determine the species) and I'm going to plant them today before Winter comes. The temperate is the problem because it's autumn and the temperature is going down, so I need to simulate the range of 20ºC to 30ºC to make them grow up. Maybe using a heat mat or a heating pad, I don't know yet. The only thing I know is that I didn't find any box to do the greenhouse.

I'm going to plant them in a pot with a plastic bag on top to simulate the greenhouse effect, but I'm not sure if it's going to work. I need to find a box to do the greenhouse, I think it's going to be better.
