Today morning rained a lot, look at my bowl.

As soon as I notice the weather alarm of Level 3 warning I went outside and checked my plants, all my plants that there are in dormancy they are outside, so I put them inside to prevent any problem. Anyways the weather was not too cold, so I put them them down the light.

I'm still studying for the exams, so I didn't do much today. However, I did some light rotation. And I watered a little bit the plants that are not in dormancy.

Finally, the best. I received the venus that I bought. I bought a Dionaea "Cupped Trap", a Dionaea "Amteborous" and a Dionaea "Tritón". They are so beautiful. Sincerely I thought that they would be bigger, but don't worry, the seller gave me an extra venus, but I don't know the species. I asked him, so when he answers me I will update the inventory.
