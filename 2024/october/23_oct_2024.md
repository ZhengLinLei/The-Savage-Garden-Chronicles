# 23th Of October 2024

It started raining at midnight, and before going to sleep I put the bowl in the balcony to see how many water can catch during the night. And for my surprise, the bowl was mid full of water, it is true that the water was a little bit dirty, but I can filter it.

I didn't take a lot of care of my plants today, I was focused on my work and my exams. And I had a mini-exam at the university, not too difficult but awful.
