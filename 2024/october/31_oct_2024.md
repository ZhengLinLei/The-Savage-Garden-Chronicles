Happy Halloween! It would be quite good to have the Venus Carboni Ardenti, but I didn't manage to get one. Everywhere it was out of stock.

The weather temperature is increasing, and the sky is still cloudy. The tragedy still continues in the north of the city where I live. They call this phenomenon "DANA" from Spanish "Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos". It's a common phenomenon in this area, but this one was the biggest I have ever seen. It destroyed all the sites near the river and the city.

All the plants are inside, and everything it seems to be fine.

## Weather

Cloudy day 16ºC - 24ºC
