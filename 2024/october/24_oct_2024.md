# 24th Of October 2024

Lot of thing to say today.

<br><br>
The weather is getting more and more colder so I think is time to put my plants in dormancy. And to avoid any damage to my nepenthes I'm going to take the nepenthes out the MeatLand, since it's a tropical plant it won't need to enter dormancy and still providing they light and temperature. Also, I identified the species of the big drosera in MeatLand, it is the Capensi Alba, and same as the Nepenthes it's a tropical plant, but for the drosera I will keep it in th MeatLand and control it daily to investigate what will happen.

I'm not going to put the MeatLand at the fridge, but I will put them in a low temperature place with entire dark environment. The temperate range will be 10ºC to 12ºC to avoiding Capensi alba dying.

<br>
And finally, in addition of such great news, a mushroom has grown in one of my terrariums, I saw it this morning before going to work and after returning home the mushroom opened up and the spores were released. Hope it doesn't affect the plants in the terrarium.
