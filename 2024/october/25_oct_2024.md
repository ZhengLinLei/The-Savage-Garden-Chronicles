# 25th Of October 2024

I regret about what I said yesterday, I going to take the drosera out eitheir. And transplant all the plants, also when I was transplating the Sarracenia Stenvensii I realised that there was three Sarracenias in the same pot so I separated them and put them in different pots. And I did the same with the Nepenthes, I separated the Nepenthes in two pots.

I searched a lot to find the species of the Nepenthes, and I think it is a hybrid of Nepenthes Ventricosa and Nepenthes Alata.

At the evening I went to the store and guess what? I found a Sarracenia tygo, it was huge and I couldn't resist to buy it. For this Sarracenia I'm not going to put it in dormancy yet, I will wait until the month ends.

Since today is raining I put the plants in the balcony to get some water and start exposing them to the cold weather and start the dormency period. I took the bowl too to collect some fresh water.
