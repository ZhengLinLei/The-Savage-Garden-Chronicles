# 10th of November 2024

Sorry for not updating the diary, I was busy and I forgot to write. I have news to tell you, I went to a greenhouse outside the city, it took me almost 1 hour to arrive walking in the middle of the roads and vehicles. I was so happy going there, but when I arrived and saw neither Sarracenias nor Droseras, I was so sad. Only some Dioaneas and Nephenthes, so I decided to buy a Nepenthes Diana.
