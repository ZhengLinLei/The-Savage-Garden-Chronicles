# 13th of November 2024

Finally today started raining and I received a warning from Civil Protection about high risk of flooding. Some places are alredy started flooding again, hope everything can be solved soon. Also the wind is very strong, I can hear the sound of the wind hitting the windows. I don't if the plants will resist to this wind. The temperatures are lower than yesterday.

Even thought I created an artificial envirnment with artificial temperature, the seeds of Drosera are not germinating. I think I will need to wait until the spring to see if they will germinate.
