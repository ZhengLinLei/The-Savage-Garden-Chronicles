# 15th of November 2024

I was transplating all my plants to small pots, I know that too much transplanting can be harmful for the plants but I have to do it because the roots are growing too much and the plants are not growing as I expected. Also I have to destroy MeatLand, I didn't like it the idea of having tank with plants inside where the wall are transparent and the light sun can accumulate inside the tank heating the top. Also there are too much soil for only 3 plants, that's ridicolous so I decided to take them out. I will show you when I finish all my repotting.
