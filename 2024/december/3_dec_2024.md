# 3rd of December 2024

I forget yesterday to close the light of the greenhouse. And it has been turned on all night. 

One of the rhizomes that I cut weeks ago without roots started growing, that's a good sign.

I have to be more careful with the light, I hope it doesn't affect the plants. And taking advantage of this error I took out the two Venus that are flowering to outdoor and I used the huminidifier to increase the humidity in the greenhouse with all the Nepenthes inside. And it has gotten wet everywhere.
