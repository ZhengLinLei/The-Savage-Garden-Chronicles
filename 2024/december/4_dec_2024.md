# 4th of December 2024

Today rained and I let the plants outside, they needed it. I tried to fix the humidity in the greenhouse, but it was difficult. I have to find a way to keep the humidity high without using humidifiers all the time. 

My drosera alba is growing a lot and I think I will have to transplant it soon. And also I want to split all the Nepenthes and cut the small pitchers to make them grow faster, or maybe I can cut it and make it grow by rhizomes.

And I have to split my drosera aliciae into three pots, they are growing a lot and they don't have enough space.
