I'm BACK!

News from all the days that I didn't update:

- One small Sarracenia died. It didn't survived the dormancy period.
- One small Venus died too. It was my first Venus, yes, the one that I put it in my terrarium :c
- I got new Nepenthes, the Nepenthes Gaya. It's a beautiful plant.

Still busy studying for the exams and finishing all the projects do I have to deliver. I will do a update for the inventory soon

Also I need help with one of my Venus, it started becoming dark and brown from the rhizome and I don't know how to fix it. Maybe it is because the quantity of water that I'm giving to it.
